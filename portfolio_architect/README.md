## 🔧 Portfolio Design Process

### 1. Candidate ETF Selection
- Select 5 candidates considering key_sectors and risk profile

### 2. Performance Analysis
- Monte Carlo simulation for each ETF (1000 iterations)
- Calculate expected returns, loss probability, volatility

### 3. Correlation Analysis
- Generate 5x5 correlation matrix
- Measure diversification effects

### 4. Optimal 3 ETF Selection
- **Balance returns and diversification effects**
- Simultaneously satisfy target return achievement and risk diversification

### 5. Investment Weight Determination
- Synthesize performance analysis and correlation results
- Allocate 100% in integer ratios

### 6. Portfolio Evaluation
- Evaluate profitability, risk management, and diversification completeness on 1-10 scale each

## 🛠️ MCP Server Tools

### analyze_etf_performance(ticker)
- **Function**: Individual ETF performance analysis (1000 Monte Carlo simulations)
- **Analysis Content**: 
  - Expected annual return calculation
  - Loss probability (principal loss possibility)
  - Historical annual return and volatility
  - Return distribution by range (7 ranges: -20% and below ~ 30% and above)
- **Data Period**: Based on 2 years of daily return data

### calculate_correlation(tickers)
- **Function**: Calculate correlation matrix between ETFs
- **Analysis Content**:
  - Generate 5x5 correlation matrix
  - Calculate correlation coefficient for each ETF pair (-1 ~ 1)
  - Measure diversification effects (lower correlation = higher diversification effect)
- **Data Period**: Based on 2 years of daily return data (minimum 100+ days of common data required)

## 🔧 Customization

### Model Configuration
```python
# portfolio_architect.py
class Config:
    MODEL_ID = "global.anthropic.claude-sonnet-4-20250514-v1:0"  # Claude 4.0 Sonnet (global cross region)
    TEMPERATURE = 0.3
    MAX_TOKENS = 3000
```

### Investment Sectors Modification
```python
# Modify options list in app.py
options=[
    "Technology Stocks",
    "Healthcare",
    # ... add/modify
]
```

## 🔗 Full System Integration

This Portfolio Architect is the second stage of the **AI Investment Advisor** system:

1. **Financial Analyst** → Financial analysis and risk profile assessment
2. **Portfolio Architect** (current) → Real-time ETF data-based portfolio design
3. **Risk Manager** → News analysis and risk scenario planning
4. **Investment Advisor** → Full agent integration and final report

The complete system can be run from `../investment_advisor/app.py`.
